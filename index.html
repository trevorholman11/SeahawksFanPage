    <h2>Welcome to the Seahawk Fan Page</h2>
    <div class="text-box">
    <p>Welcome, 12s, to the ultimate home for all things Seattle Seahawks! Whether
         you’ve been cheering from the Kingdome days or joined the wave during the 
         unforgettable Legion of Boom era, this is your place to celebrate the pride, 
         energy, passion, and history of the Hawks. Who could forget the bone-rattling 
         hits of Kam Chancellor, Richard Sherman’s swagger, or the sheer brilliance of 
         Earl Thomas and Bobby Wagner? The Legion of Boom wasn’t just a defense—it was a 
         movement that led the Seahawks to their first Super Bowl title and cemented Seattle 
         as a force to be reckoned with. Here, you’ll find everything you need to stay 
         connected to your team, from breaking news and player updates to game recaps and 
         insider analysis. This is your hub, built by fans, for fans—because once you’re a 
         Hawk, you’re always part of the flock.</p>
